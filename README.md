# Data Structures implemented in C++
This is a personal project for me to expand my knowledge on common data structures. I'm utilizing the [Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/) course on Udemy taught by Abdul Bari. 

While the course is catered for C users, implementing the data structures in C++ should theoretically be straightforward.

I know the STL has most, if not all, of these data structures already implemented, so while this repo will be a great exercise in expanding my knowledge, the code will most likely not be utilized by me in the future other than as an example of implementation of some data structures.

If you happened upon this repo, welcome! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about what I have done or to give me feedback.
